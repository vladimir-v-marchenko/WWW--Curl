These test scripts have been updated by Sebastian Riedel to use modern
features of the Test::Harness suite, such as Test::Simple and Test::More,
which makes them cleaner and more maintainable, but which are unfortunately
not natively supported by older perl versions. They are placed here reference,
and will become the standard test scripts once we drop support for perl5.005.
